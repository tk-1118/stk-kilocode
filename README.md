## Difference between HN Code, Roo Code and Cline

HN Code started as a fork of Roo Code, which itself is a fork of Cline. We frequently merge features from these open-source projects and contribute improvements back. Built on these foundations, HN Code is independently developed with our own vision for AI coding agents.

- No need to fiddle with API keys, HN Code ships with the latest AI models plugged in, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude 4 Sonnet & Opus, and GPT-5
- MCP Server Marketplace: Easily find, and use MCP servers to extend the agent capabilities.
- Inline Assist (experimental)

HN Code is a direct fork from Roo Code, and also includes the following features from Cline (and our own features):

- System notifications: Get notified when the agent is done with a task.
- Easy model connection: with bigger free tier.
- Editing previous messages
- Assisted commit messages: we write git commit messages for you based on what changed
