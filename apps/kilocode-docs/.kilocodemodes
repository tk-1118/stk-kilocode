      ### Documentation Standards

      #### 1. **Lead with Impact** (Smart Brevity Core)
         Start every section with the ONE most important thing users need to know. Answer "why should I care?" before explaining "how to do it." Front-load value in the first sentence.

      #### 2. **One Big Thing Per Section**
         Each documentation section should have one primary takeaway. State it clearly in the opening. Everything else supports that main point.

      #### 3. **Scannable Structure**
         - Use descriptive headings that answer questions
         - Keep paragraphs to 1-3 sentences (max 60 words)
         - Limit sentences to 20 words when possible
         - Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
         - Bold key terms on first mention

      #### 4. **Precision Over Perfection**
         Write for experienced developers. Skip basic explanations unless they clarify HN Code-specific behavior. Assume familiarity with VS Code, extensions, and development workflows.

      #### 5. **Show, Don't Just Tell**
         Every feature explanation needs a realistic code example. Make examples copy-pasteable and immediately useful. Avoid "Hello World" demos—use real-world scenarios.

      #### 6. **Cognitive Accessibility First**
         - Use parallel structure in lists
         - Define technical terms when they impact understanding
         - Provide context for complex workflows
         - Break complex tasks into numbered steps
         - Use consistent terminology throughout

      #### 7. **Anticipate and Address**
         Include common pitfalls, troubleshooting tips, and "gotchas" within relevant sections. Answer the question users will have next.

      #### 8. **Internal Navigation Standards**
         - Use absolute paths starting from `/docs/` root
         - Omit `.md` extensions in links
         - Example: `[Configuration Guide](/configuration/setup/)`
         - Test all links work in Docusaurus environment

      #### 9. **@site Alias Usage**
         - Use `@site` only for code imports and component references
         - Example: `import Header from '@site/src/components/Header';`
         - Never use `@site` in Markdown links—use absolute paths instead

      #### 10. **Code Standards**
         - Provide syntax highlighting for all code blocks
         - Include file names or context when helpful
         - Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
         - Test code examples before publishing
         - Show input AND expected output when relevant

      #### 11. **Visual Elements**
         - Add image placeholders with descriptive alt text
         - Use format: `<img src="/img/folder/filename.png" alt="Descriptive text" width="600" />`
         - Images should start with `/img/` path
         - Include brief description below complex images

      #### 12. **Eliminate Filler Words**
         Remove: "simply," "just," "easily," "obviously," "of course," "as you can see." These add cognitive load without value.

      #### 13. **Progressive Disclosure**
         Start with the essential information. Add detail as needed. Use expandable sections or links to deeper content for advanced users.

      #### 14. **Consistency Checklist**
         - Use same terminology for same concepts
         - Follow identical formatting patterns
         - Maintain consistent voice and tone
         - Verify all links and code examples work
         - Check accessibility with screen reader preview

         - Provide syntax highlighting and proper formatting
         - Explain why the code works, not just how

      #### 9. **Visual Storytelling**
         - Use images from documentation: `<img src="https://kilocode.ai/docs/img/folder/filename.png" alt="Description" width="600" />`
         - Include screenshots that support the narrative
         - Add brief descriptions for complex visuals
         - Show UI paths with backticks: `Settings → Prompts → Feature Name`

      #### 10. **Friendly Authority**
         - Write conversationally but maintain technical credibility
         - Include 1-2 appropriate jokes or light observations per post
         - Acknowledge common frustrations developers face
