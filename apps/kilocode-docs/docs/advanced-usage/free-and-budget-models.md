# Using HN Code for Free and on a Budget

**Why this matters:** AI model costs can add up quickly during development. This guide shows you how to use HN Code effectively while minimizing or eliminating costs through free models, budget-friendly alternatives, and smart usage strategies.

## Completely Free Options

### Grok Code Fast 1

This frontier AI model is 100% free in HN Code for a limited time. [See the blog post for more details](https://blog.kilocode.ai/p/grok-code-fast-get-this-frontier-ai-model-free).

### OpenRouter Free Tier Models

OpenRouter offers several models with generous free tiers. **Note:** You'll need to create a free OpenRouter account to access these models.

**Setup:**

1. Create a free [OpenRouter account](https://openrouter.ai)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Configure HN Code with the OpenRouter provider

**Available free models:**

- **Qwen3 Coder (free)** - Optimized for agentic coding tasks such as function calling, tool use, and long-context reasoning over repositories.
- **Z.AI: GLM 4.5 Air (free)** - Lightweight variant of the GLM-4.5 family, purpose-built for agent-centric applications.
- **DeepSeek: R1 0528 (free)** - Performance on par with OpenAI o1, but open-sourced and with fully open reasoning tokens.
- **MoonshotAI: Kimi K2 (free)** - Optimized for agentic capabilities, including advanced tool use, reasoning, and code synthesis.

## Cost-Effective Premium Models

When you need more capability than free models provide, these options deliver excellent value:

### Ultra-Budget Champions (Under $0.50 per million tokens)

**Mistral Devstral Small**

- **Cost:** ~$0.20 per million input tokens
- **Best for:** Code generation, debugging, refactoring
- **Performance:** 85% of premium model capability at 10% of the cost

**Llama 4 Maverick**

- **Cost:** ~$0.30 per million input tokens
- **Best for:** Complex reasoning, architecture planning
- **Performance:** Excellent for most development tasks

**DeepSeek v3**

- **Cost:** ~$0.27 per million input tokens
- **Best for:** Code analysis, large codebase understanding
- **Performance:** Strong technical reasoning

### Mid-Range Value Models ($0.50-$2.00 per million tokens)

**Qwen3 235B**

- **Cost:** ~$1.20 per million input tokens
- **Best for:** Complex projects requiring high accuracy
- **Performance:** Near-premium quality at 40% of the cost

## Smart Usage Strategies

### The 50% Rule

**Principle:** Use budget models for 50% of your tasks, premium models for the other 50%.

**Budget model tasks:**

- Code reviews and analysis
- Documentation writing
- Simple bug fixes
- Boilerplate generation
- Refactoring existing code

**Premium model tasks:**

- Complex architecture decisions
- Debugging difficult issues
- Performance optimization
- New feature design
- Critical production code

### Context Management for Cost Savings

**Minimize context size:**

```typescript
// Instead of mentioning entire files
@src/components/UserProfile.tsx

// Mention specific functions or sections
@src/components/UserProfile.tsx:45-67
```

**Use Memory Bank effectively:**

- Store project context once in [Memory Bank](/advanced-usage/memory-bank)
- Reduces need to re-explain project details
- Saves 200-500 tokens per conversation

**Strategic file mentions:**

- Only include files directly relevant to the task
- Use [`@folder/`](/basic-usage/context-mentions) for broad context, specific files for targeted work

### Model Switching Strategies

**Start cheap, escalate when needed:**

1. **Begin with free models** (Qwen3 Coder, GLM-4.5-Air)
2. **Switch to budget models** if free models struggle
3. **Escalate to premium models** only for complex tasks

**Use API Configuration Profiles:**

- Set up [multiple profiles](/features/api-configuration-profiles) for different cost tiers
- Quick switching between free, budget, and premium models
- Match model capability to task complexity

### Mode-Based Cost Optimization

**Use appropriate modes to limit expensive operations:**

- **[Ask Mode](/basic-usage/using-modes#ask-mode):** Information gathering without code changes
- **[Architect Mode](/basic-usage/using-modes#architect-mode):** Planning without expensive file operations
- **[Debug Mode](/basic-usage/using-modes#debug-mode):** Focused troubleshooting

**Custom modes for budget control:**

- Create modes that restrict expensive tools
- Limit file access to specific directories
- Control which operations are auto-approved

## Real-World Performance Comparisons

### Code Generation Tasks

**Simple function creation:**

- **Mistral Devstral Small:** 95% success rate
- **GPT-4:** 98% success rate
- **Cost difference:** Free vs $0.20 vs $30 per million tokens

**Complex refactoring:**

- **Budget models:** 70-80% success rate
- **Premium models:** 90-95% success rate
- **Recommendation:** Start with budget, escalate if needed

### Debugging Performance

**Simple bugs:**

- **Free models:** Usually sufficient
- **Budget models:** Excellent performance
- **Premium models:** Overkill for most cases

**Complex system issues:**

- **Free models:** 40-60% success rate
- **Budget models:** 60-80% success rate
- **Premium models:** 85-95% success rate

## Hybrid Approach Recommendations

### Daily Development Workflow

### Cost-Saving Tips

**Reduce system prompt size:**

- [Disable MCP](/features/mcp/using-mcp-in-kilo-code) if not using external tools
- Use focused custom modes
- Minimize unnecessary context

**Optimize conversation length:**

- Use [Checkpoints](/features/checkpoints) to reset context
- Start fresh conversations for unrelated tasks
- Archive completed work

**Batch similar tasks:**

- Group related code changes
- Handle multiple files in single requests
- Reduce conversation overhead
