# Custom Instructions

Custom Instructions allow you to personalize how HN Code behaves, providing specific guidance that shapes responses, coding style, and decision-making processes.

## What Are Custom Instructions?

Custom Instructions define specific Extension behaviors, preferences, and constraints beyond Kilo's basic role definition. Examples include coding style, documentation standards, testing requirements, and workflow guidelines.

:::info Custom Instructions vs Rules
Custom Instructions are IDE-wide and are applied across all workspaces and maintain your preferences regardless of which project you're working on. Unlike Instructions, [Custom Rules](/advanced-usage/custom-rules.md) are project specific and allow you to setup workspace-based ruleset.

        If the mode itself is global (not workspace-specific), any custom instructions you set for it will also apply globally for that mode across all workspaces.
