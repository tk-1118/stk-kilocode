# Setting up HN Code

When you sign up for HN Code, you'll receive **free credits** to help you get started. To claim your credits:

1. **Sign up:** Complete the registration process to receive $5 in credits immediately after verification (we might require a hold to verify identity)
2. **First top-up:** Add funds to your account (min $5) and get $20 bonus credits
3. **Start Coding:** Enjoy your $25 in total free credits

:::note About the temporary hold
The $0.50 hold is for identity verification only:

- **Not a charge** - This is a temporary authorization that will not be charged
- **Instant release** - HN Code releases the hold immediately after verification
- **Bank processing** - While we release instantly, it may take a few business days for funds to return (varies by bank)
