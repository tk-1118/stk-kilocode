# Connecting an AI Provider

HN Code requires an API key from an AI model provider to function.

We recommend these options for accessing the powerful **Claude 4 Sonnet** model:

- **HN Code API provider (Recommended):** Provides access to all of the models available through OpenRouter with competitive pricing and free credits to get started. [View pricing](https://kilocode.ai/pricing)
- **OpenRouter:** Provides access to multiple AI models through a single API key. [View pricing](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=pricing-low-to-high).
- **Anthropic:** Direct access to Claude models. Requires API access approval and may have [rate limits depending on your tier](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/rate-limits#requirements-to-advance-tier). See [Anthropic's pricing page](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing#anthropic-api) for details.

## Using the HN Code Provider

By default when you install HN Code the extension, you'll be prompted to sign in or create an account in the [HN Code Provider](/providers/kilocode).

That will walk you through the account setup and _automatically_ configure HN Code properly to get you started. If you'd rather use another provider, you'll need to manually get your API key as described below.

## Using another API Provider

### Getting Your API Key

#### Option 1: LLM Routers

LLM routers let you access multiple AI models with one API key, simplifying cost management and switching between models. They often offer [competitive pricing](https://openrouter.ai/models?order=pricing-low-to-high) compared to direct providers.

##### OpenRouter

1. Go to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Sign in with your Google or GitHub account
3. Navigate to the [API keys page](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and create a new key
4. Copy your API key - you'll need this for HN Code setup
