# Context Mentions

Context mentions are a powerful way to provide HN Code with specific information about your project, allowing it to perform tasks more accurately and efficiently. You can use mentions to refer to files, folders, problems, and Git commits. Context mentions start with the `@` symbol.

## Types of Mentions

_File mentions add actual code content into the conversation for direct reference and analysis._

| Mention Type    | Format                 | Description                                 | Example Usage                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **File**        | `@/path/to/file.ts`    | Includes file contents in request context   | "Explain the function in @/src/utils.ts" |

## How to Use Mentions

1. Type `@` in the chat input to trigger the suggestions dropdown
2. Continue typing to filter suggestions or use arrow keys to navigate
3. Select with Enter key or mouse click
4. Combine multiple mentions in a request: "Fix @problems in @/src/component.ts"

The dropdown automatically suggests:

- Recently opened files
- Visible folders
- Recent git commits
- Special keywords (`problems`, `terminal`, `git-changes`)

## Best Practices

| Practice                   | Description                                                                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use specific paths**     | Reference exact files rather than describing them                                |
| **Use relative paths**     | Always start from workspace root: `@/src/file.ts` not `@C:/Projects/src/file.ts` |
| **Verify references**      | Ensure paths and commit hashes are correct                                       |
| **Click mentions**         | Click mentions in chat history to open files or view content                     |
| **Eliminate copy-pasting** | Use mentions instead of manually copying code or errors                          |
| **Combine mentions**       | "Fix @problems in @/src/component.ts using the pattern from commit @a1b2c3d"     |
