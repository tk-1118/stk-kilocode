# Chatting with HN Code

:::tip

**Bottom line:** HN Code is an AI coding assistant that lives in VS Code. You chat with it in plain English, and it writes, edits, and explains code for you.

:::

## Quick Setup

Find the HN Code icon (<img src="/docs/img/kilo-v1.svg" width="12" />) in VS Code's Primary Side Bar. Click it to open the chat panel.

**Lost the panel?** Go to View > Open View... and search for "HN Code"

## How to Talk to HN Code

**The key insight:** Just type what you want in normal English. No special commands needed.

**Good requests:**

```
create a new file named utils.py and add a function called add that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum
```

```
in the file @src/components/Button.tsx, change the color of the button to blue
```

```
find all instances of the variable oldValue in @/src/App.js and replace them with newValue
```

**What makes requests work:**

- **Be specific** - "Fix the bug in `calculateTotal` that returns incorrect results" beats "Fix the code"
- **Use @ mentions** - Reference files and code directly with `@filename`
- **One task at a time** - Break complex work into manageable steps
- **Include examples** - Show the style or format you want

## The Chat Interface

**Status signals:**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Instead of this...          | Try this                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Fix the code"              | "Fix the bug in `calculateTotal` that returns incorrect results" |
| Assuming Kilo knows context | Use `@` to reference specific files                              |
| Multiple unrelated tasks    | Submit one focused request at a time                             |
| Technical jargon overload   | Clear, straightforward language works best                       |

**Why it matters:** HN Code works best when you communicate like you're talking to a smart teammate who needs clear direction.
