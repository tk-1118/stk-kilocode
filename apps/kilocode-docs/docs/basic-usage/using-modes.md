# Using Modes

Modes in HN Code are specialized personas that tailor the assistant's behavior to your current task. Each mode offers different capabilities, expertise, and access levels to help you accomplish specific goals.

## Why Use Different Modes?

- **Task specialization:** Get precisely the type of assistance you need for your current task
- **Safety controls:** Prevent unintended file modifications when focusing on planning or learning
- **Focused interactions:** Receive responses optimized for your current activity
- **Workflow optimization:** Seamlessly transition between planning, implementing, debugging, and learning

3. **Toggle command/Keyboard shortcut:** Use the keyboard shortcut below, applicable to your operating system. Each press cycles through the available modes in sequence, wrapping back to the first mode after reaching the end.

    | Operating System | Shortcut |
    | ---------------- | -------- |
    | macOS            | ⌘ + .    |
    | Windows          | Ctrl + . |
    | Linux            | Ctrl + . |

4. **Accept suggestions:** Click on mode switch suggestions that HN Code offers when appropriate
