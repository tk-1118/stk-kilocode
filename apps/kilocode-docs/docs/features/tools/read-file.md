# read_file

The `read_file` tool examines the contents of files in a project. It allows HN Code to understand code, configuration files, and documentation to provide better assistance.

## Parameters

The tool accepts these parameters:

- `path` (required): The path of the file to read relative to the current working directory
- `start_line` (optional): The starting line number to read from (1-based indexing)
- `end_line` (optional): The ending line number to read to (1-based, inclusive)
- `auto_truncate` (optional): Whether to automatically truncate large files when line range isn't specified (true/false)

## What It Does

This tool reads the content of a specified file and returns it with line numbers for easy reference. It can read entire files or specific sections, and even extract text from PDFs and Word documents.

## When is it used?

- When HN Code needs to understand existing code structure
- When HN Code needs to analyze configuration files
- When HN Code needs to extract information from text files
- When HN Code needs to see code before suggesting changes
- When specific line numbers need to be referenced in discussions

## Key Features

- Displays file content with line numbers for easy reference
- Can read specific portions of files by specifying line ranges
- Extracts readable text from PDF and DOCX files
- Intelligently truncates large files to focus on the most relevant sections
- Provides method summaries with line ranges for large code files
- Efficiently streams only requested line ranges for better performance
- Makes it easy to discuss specific parts of code with line numbering

## Limitations

- May not handle extremely large files efficiently without using line range parameters
- For binary files (except PDF and DOCX), may return content that isn't human-readable

## How It Works

When the `read_file` tool is invoked, it follows this process:

1. **Parameter Validation**: Validates the required `path` parameter and optional parameters
2. **Path Resolution**: Resolves the relative path to an absolute path
3. **Reading Strategy Selection**:
    - The tool uses a strict priority hierarchy (explained in detail below)
    - It chooses between range reading, auto-truncation, or full file reading
4. **Content Processing**:
    - Adds line numbers to the content (e.g., "1 | const x = 13") where `1 |` is the line number.
    - For truncated files, adds truncation notice and method definitions
    - For special formats (PDF, DOCX, IPYNB), extracts readable text

## Reading Strategy Priority

The tool uses a clear decision hierarchy to determine how to read a file:

1. **First Priority: Explicit Line Range**

    - If either `start_line` or `end_line` is provided, the tool always performs a range read
    - The implementation efficiently streams only the requested lines, making it suitable for processing large files
    - This takes precedence over all other options

2. **Second Priority: Auto-Truncation for Large Files**

    - This only applies when ALL of these conditions are met:
        - Neither `start_line` nor `end_line` is specified
        - The `auto_truncate` parameter is set to `true`
        - The file is not a binary file
        - The file exceeds the configured line threshold (typically 500-1000 lines)
    - When auto-truncation activates, the tool:
        - Reads only the first portion of the file (determined by the maxReadFileLine setting)
        - Adds a truncation notice showing the number of lines displayed vs. total
        - Provides a summary of method definitions with their line ranges

3. **Default Behavior: Read Entire File**
    - If neither of the above conditions are met, it reads the entire file content
    - For special formats like PDF, DOCX, and IPYNB, it uses specialized extractors

## Examples When Used

- When asked to explain or improve code, HN Code first reads the relevant files to understand the current implementation.
- When troubleshooting configuration issues, HN Code reads config files to identify potential problems.
- When working with documentation, HN Code reads existing docs to understand the current content before suggesting improvements.

## Usage Examples

Here are several scenarios demonstrating how the `read_file` tool is used and the typical output you might receive.

### Reading an Entire File

To read the complete content of a file:

**Input:**

```xml
<read_file>
<path>src/app.js</path>
</read_file>
```

**Simulated Output (for a small file like `example_small.txt`):**

```
1 | This is the first line.
2 | This is the second line.
3 | This is the third line.
```

_(Output will vary based on the actual file content)_

### Reading Specific Lines

To read only a specific range of lines (e.g., 46-68):

**Input:**

```xml
<read_file>
<path>src/app.js</path>
<start_line>46</start_line>
<end_line>68</end_line>
</read_file>
```

**Simulated Output (for lines 2-3 of `example_five_lines.txt`):**

```
2 | Content of line two.
3 | Content of line three.
```

_(Output shows only the requested lines with their original line numbers)_

### Reading a Large File (Auto-Truncation)

When reading a large file without specifying lines and `auto_truncate` is enabled (or defaults to true based on settings):

**Input:**

```xml
<read_file>
<path>src/large-module.js</path>
<auto_truncate>true</auto_truncate> <!-- Optional if default is true -->
</read_file>
```

**Simulated Output (for `large_file.log` with 1500 lines, limit 1000):**

```
1 | Log entry 1...
2 | Log entry 2...
...
1000 | Log entry 1000...
[... truncated 500 lines ...]
```

_(Output is limited to the configured maximum lines, with a truncation notice)_

### Attempting to Read a Non-Existent File

If the specified file does not exist:

**Input:**

```xml
<read_file>
<path>non_existent_file.txt</path>
</read_file>
```

**Simulated Output (Error):**

```
Error: File not found at path 'non_existent_file.txt'.
```

### Attempting to Read a Blocked File

If the file is excluded by rules in a `.kilocodeignore` file:

**Input:**

```xml
<read_file>
<path>.env</path>
</read_file>
```

**Simulated Output (Error):**

```
Error: Access denied to file '.env' due to .kilocodeignore rules.
```
