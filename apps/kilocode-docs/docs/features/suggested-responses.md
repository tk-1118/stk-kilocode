# Suggested Responses

When HN Code needs more information to complete a task, it uses the [`ask_followup_question` tool](/features/tools/ask-followup-question). To make responding easier and faster, HN Code often provides suggested answers alongside the question.

## Overview

Suggested Responses appear as clickable buttons directly below HN Code's question in the chat interface. They offer pre-formulated answers relevant to the question, helping you provide input quickly.

## How It Works

1.  **Question Appears**: HN Code asks a question using the `ask_followup_question` tool.
2.  **Suggestions Displayed**: If suggestions are provided by HN Code, they appear as buttons below the question.
3.  **Interaction**: You can interact with these suggestions in two ways.

## Interacting with Suggestions

You have two options for using suggested responses:

1.  **Direct Selection**:

    - **Action**: Simply click the button containing the answer you want to provide.
    - **Result**: The selected answer is immediately sent back to HN Code as your response. This is the quickest way to reply if one of the suggestions perfectly matches your intent.

2.  **Edit Before Sending**:
    - **Action**:
        - Hold down `Shift` and click the suggestion button.
        - _Alternatively_, hover over the suggestion button and click the pencil icon (<Codicon name="edit" />) that appears.
    - **Result**: The text of the suggestion is copied into the chat input box. You can then modify the text as needed before pressing Enter to send your customized response. This is useful when a suggestion is close but needs minor adjustments.

## Benefits

- **Speed**: Quickly respond without typing full answers.
- **Clarity**: Suggestions often clarify the type of information HN Code needs.
- **Flexibility**: Edit suggestions to provide precise, customized answers when needed.

This feature streamlines the interaction when HN Code requires clarification, allowing you to guide the task effectively with minimal effort.
