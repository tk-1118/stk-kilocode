# Using HN Code's Built-in Provider

HN Code provides its own built-in API provider that gives you access to the latest frontier coding models through a simple registration process. No need to manage API keys from multiple providers - just sign up and start coding.

**Website:** [https://kilocode.ai/](https://kilocode.ai/)

## Getting Started with Free Credits

When you sign up for HN Code, you'll receive free credits to help you get started:

1. **Sign up:** Complete the registration process to receive $5 in credits immediately after verification (we might require a hold to verify identity)

3. **Start Coding:** Enjoy your $25 in total free credits

:::note About the temporary hold
The $0.50 hold is for identity verification only:

- **Not a charge** - This is a temporary authorization that will not be charged
- **Instant release** - HN Code releases the hold immediately after verification
- **Bank processing** - While we release instantly, it may take a few business days for funds to return (varies by bank)
