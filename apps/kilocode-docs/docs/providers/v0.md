# Using v0 With HN Code

HN Code supports v0, Vercel's AI model provider that offers an OpenAI-compatible API. This allows you to use v0's models with HN Code through the familiar OpenAI API interface.

## Prerequisites

To use v0 with HN Code, you'll need:

- A team account with Vercel v0
- A v0 API key

## Configuration

Setting up v0 in HN Code is straightforward:

1. In HN Code settings (click the <Codicon name="gear" /> icon):
    - Under **API Provider**, select: **OpenAI Compatible**
    - Set the **Base URL**: `https://api.v0.dev/v1`
    - Paste in your v0 API key
    - Set the **Model ID**: `v0-1.0-md`
    - Click **Verify** to confirm the connection

- `v0-1.0-md` - v0's multimodal model that supports both text and image inputs

- `v0-1.5.md` - composite model ([learn more](https://vercel.com/blog/v0-composite-model-family))

## Troubleshooting

- **"Invalid API Key":** Double-check that you've entered the API key correctly.
- **"Model Not Found":** Make sure you're using the correct model ID (`v0-1.0-md`).
- **Connection Errors:** Verify the Base URL is correct (`https://api.v0.dev/v1`).
- **Access Issues:** Confirm that your Vercel v0 team account is active and properly set up.
